# Tryst 2017 

## Team 6

This repository contains the workfiles for team 6 in the Tryst 2016 competition held in Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi every year. As a team. we stood the 4th.

### Aim 
 
The main aim was to build two bots - a land and a water bot. The land bot had to run through an obstacle course and pick up three rings on the way. These three rings had to passed down to a water bot which had to place it on three different poles located in a water body.

### Setup

Bay is where we transferred the rings to the water bot. For meeting such demanding requirements we used : an Arduino Mega, 12V Lead Acid Batteries and a custom built motor driver. This was done using this site as a refernce : [H-Bridge Motor Drivers](http://www.bristolwatch.com/ele/h_bridge.htm)
Also the remote control was done using the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) 

### Status and content of this repo

This repository is now archived and depreciated. The SWEEP folder contains code to directly run a servo motor without any I2C servo driving chip.
