This repository contains the workfiles for team 6 in the Tryst 2016 competition held in Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi every year. As a team. we stood the 4th.

### Aim 
 
The main aim was to build two bots - a land and a water bot. The land bot had to run through an obstacle course and pick up three rings on the way. These three rings had to passed down to a water bot which had to place it on three different poles located in a water body.
